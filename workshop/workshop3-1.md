# S-DOEA - Workshop 5 - Terraform and Ansible

## Pre-requisites 
* Digital Ocean Account

## Terraform (a)

### Objective
The objective of this workshop is use Terraform’s HCL to write scripts to
provision Docker containers and a reverse proxy.

### Setup
For this workshop create a directory call workshop01 in the repository you
have create in step a. above. All the files for this workshop should be created in
workshop01 directory.


### Workshop
In this workshop you will automate the provisioning of the following
infrastructure shown in the following diagram.

<br>


The infrastructure stack consists of
1. Docker network called bgg-net
2. Container running MySQL database (bgg-database) inside bgg-net
3. A specified number of containers running a Nodejs application (bggbackend). These web applications connect to MySQL database. These
applications are also provisioned inside bgg-net
4. An instance of Nginx running on a separate server which routes traffic to
the bgg-backend instances.

The following are detail description of provisioning each of the resource in the
stack.

### Network (bgg-net)
• Create a Docker network called bgg-net. This network will be used for all
the containers in our application.

### Database (bgg-database)
• Provision a Docker volume to be used by the database.
• Use the image chukmunnlee/bgg-database:v3.1 to create the
bgg-database container
• Mount the Docker volume that you have created under
/var/lib/mysql. The database will be created in this volume rather
that inside the container
• Expose MySQL port 3306
• The database should be created inside bgg-net network

### Application (bgg-backend)
• Create 3 instances of the application using the following image:
chukmunnlee/bgg-backend:v3
• Add the following environment variables
o BGG_DB_USER set to root
o BGG_DB_PASSWORD set to changeit
o BGG_DB_HOST set to the application database resource name
• The internal port of the application is 3000. Choose a suitable external port
to port bind to

### Nginx Reverse Proxy
• Provision a Ubuntu server. Use Ubuntu 20.04 x64
• Add a SSH key to the server so you can SSH into the server
• Install Nginx and enable the service with the following commands
o /usr/bin/apt update -y
o /usr/bin/apt upgrade -y


o /usr/bin/apt install nginx -y
o /usr/bin/systemctl start nginx
o /usr/bin/systemctl enable nginx
• Create a Nginx configuration file called nginx.conf with the container
endpoints. Use the following template

```
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
events {
    worker_connections 768;
}
http: {
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
    gzip on;
    upstream apps {
        least_conn;
        # the following list the container endpoints
        # one server line for each endpoint
        # eg server <docker_host_ip>:<exposed_port>;
        server docker_host_ip:exposed_port_0;
        server docker_host_ip:exposed_port_1;
        server docker_host_ip:exposed_port_2;
    }
    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://apps;
        }
    }
}

```
Hint: this configuration file should be generated from the bgg-backend
external ports
• Replace the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf on the reverse proxy with your
nginx.conf.
• Signal Nginx to reload the new configuration with the following command
o /usr/sbin/nginx -s reload, or
o /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx


### Outputs
Your Terraform script should produce the following artefacts and outputs
• Reverse proxy IP address
• List of all the container endpoint in the following format
<docker_host_ip>:<exposed_port>
• An empty file call root@<reverse_proxy_ip >

### Test
Test your deployment by browsing to http://<reverse_proxy_ip>.
You should see the following

### Submission

## Ansible (b)


The objective of this workshop is to automate the installation of Code-Server
on a server


### Setup
a. Create a directory called workshop02 in your course repository.

b. Read Step 1 and Step 2 of the following blog
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-the-code-server-cloud-ide-platform-on-ubuntu-20-04

### Workshop
Provision a Ubuntu server for this exercise. You can use Terraform or manually
provision an instance on DigitalOcean’s console.
Once you have provisioned, note the IP address, root user and SSH keys used.
Use these information to create an inventory file, inventory.yaml.
Write a playbook that will use the inventory.yaml file to configure the
server. The playbook should perform the following tasks

• Update the /lib/systemd/system/code-server.service file
with the code server password; change the following line


```
Environment=PASSWORD=__PLACEHOLDER__
```
with the password, assuming that the password is mypassword

```
Environment=PASSWORD=”mypassword”
```

• Update the /etc/nginx/sites-available/code-server.conf
file with the domain code-<ipv4_address>.nip.io; change the line
with server_name to

```
server_name code-<ipv4_address>.nip.io;

```
• Use systemd module to restart nginx and code-server services. You
must also perform a daemon reload viz. set daemon_reload to yes.

### Test
Test your deployment by browsing to http://```<ip-address>```

### Submission
When you have completed this workshop, commit your work to the repository.
The instructor will clone your repository at the end
